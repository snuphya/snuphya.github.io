Stage 5: (Advanced) YBE-powered compression
===========================================

Finally, we implement the YBE-powered quantum circuit compression scheme
for the linear-depth Trotterization circuits constructed in Stage 3. Under 
certain conditions on the coupling constants, we will obtain circuits
whose depth is totally independent of the Trotter number! 

This means we can approximate the time propagator $U(t)$ to arbitrary accuracy
without paying **any** cost in terms of added circuit depth. The catch is that
we must be willing to expend some (classical) computation up front in order to 
find appropriate parameters for the compressed circuit.

The approximation scheme relies on two circuit identities, known as 
*reflection symmetry* and *merge* in :cite:t:`peng`. The first is a
YBE; when at least one of the coupling constants is zero, there exist
parameters $\theta', \theta''$, and $\theta'''$ such that, for instance,

.. math::
    
    B_j(\theta) B_{j+1}(\theta) B_j(\theta) 
    = B_{j+1}(\theta') B_j(\theta'') B_{j+1}(\theta'''),

for any given initial parameter choice. The figure below illustrates the
so-called reflection symmetry.

The so-called *merge* identity allows for merging two blocks in acting on the
pair of sites into one; in particular,

.. math::

    B_j(\theta) B_j(\theta') = B_j(\theta + \theta')

for any $\theta, \theta' \in \mathbb{R}^3$.

When combined, these identities explain the circuit compression scheme. For instance,
if we consdier $N = 3$ sites and use $n = 2$ Trotter steps, we can compress the
Trotterized circuit as follows:

.. math::
    
    \begin{align*}
        U(t) &\approx \big(B_1(\theta) B_2(\theta) \big)^2 \\
        &= \big(B_1(\theta) B_2(\theta)\big) \big(B_1(\theta) B_2(\theta)\big) \\
        &= \big(B_1(\theta) B_2(\theta) B_1(\theta)\big) B_2(\theta) \\
        &= \big(B_2(\theta') B_1(\theta'') B_2(\theta''')\big) B_2(\theta) \\ 
        &= B_2(\theta') B_1(\theta'') B_2(\theta''' + \theta),
    \end{align*}

The problem is finding the new parameters $\theta'$, $\theta''$, and $\theta'''$.
For simplicity, we will assume a black-box algorithm for to complete this task:
simply use the provided :meth:`src.circuit_compressor.get_optimized_params`
method.

The compression scheme can be extended to longer spin chains. For instance,
the figure below, taken from :cite:t:`peng`, illustrates how to compose a
sequence of symmetry reflections to produce the *mirror* identity that can
be used to compress circuits with $N = 4$ qubits.

The following figure, also taken from :cite:t:`peng`, illustrates how to combine the
mirror and merge identities to produce a compression scheme for $N = 4$ lattice sites.

It turns out that for any number of Trotter steps $n$, you can always compress the Trotterized
evolution circuit on $N$ sites down to a quantum circuit with just $N (N-1) / 2$ block operators.
You can prove this below in the algebraic formulation section.

Constant-depth(!) time evolution under certain Heisenberg Hamiltonians
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For the rest of this section, assume $J_y = h = 0$, so we will focus on the
$H_x + H_z$ Hamiltonian.

Now implement the YBE-powered compression scheme for $N = 3, 4$ sites using the
"moves" illustrated in the figures above. Do this in three steps: first implement
the :meth:`.CircuitCompressor.get_ybe_update` method, then the
:meth:`.CircuitCompressor.get_mirror_update` method, and finally proceed to the
:meth:`.CircuitCompressor.compress_circuit` method. 

*Hint*: Label the blocks in the circuit and identify which sets of parameters are
involved in each symmetry application.

.. admonition:: Exercise 5.1

    Now modify the ``xyz_evolution_challenge.ipynb`` notebook so it also computes the
    staggered magnetization $M_{\mathrm{stag}}(t)$ using the compressed circuits for
    $N = 3$ and $N = 4$ sites. Comment on your results and include your plots showing
    four magnetization curves on the same set of axes for each $N$.

.. admonition:: Challenge!

    Use the reflection symmetry and the merge identity to design and implement a compression
    scheme for circuits on $N > 4$ lattice sites. Report the complexity of your algorithm
    as the number of reflection symmetries required.

(Expert) Algebraic formulation 
------------------------------

To conclude, we prove the following theorem:

    Suppose the block operators $B_j$ satisfy the YBE. Then any Trotterized evolution 
    circuit constructed considered here, using any number of block operators, may be 
    expressed as an **equivalent** circuit with depth at most $N$ and using at most
    $N(N-1)/2$ blocks.

We consider a parameter-independent version of the block operators by simply forgetting they 
are parametrized. However, we do not lose generality; we may easily extend the results to the 
parameter-dependent case by appropriately updating the parameters in each block after each symmetry 
application. 

Under the YBE hypothesis, the block operators generate a representation of the
`Artin braid group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_group>`_ $\mathcal{B}_n$, which is
generated by $b_1, \ldots, b_n$ subject to the *braid relations*:

.. math::
    b_j b_{j+1} b_j = b_{j+1} b_j b_{j+1}, \quad\text{and}\quad b_j b_k = b_k b_j 
    \text{ whenever } |k - j| > 1.

Incidentally, the topological quantum computation model is also based on unitary representations
of the braid group :cite:t:`willie_aqc`.

In addition to the braid relations, the block operators satisfy 
$B_j(\theta)B_j(\theta') = B_j(\theta + \theta')$, which becomes $B_j^2 = B_j$ in the 
parameter-independent version. 

Therefore, we can state more precisely that the block operators generate a representation of the 
$0$-Hecke algebra. The 
`Iwahori-Hecke algebra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwahoriâ€“Hecke_algebra>`_ $H_n(q)$ is
generated by $T_1, \ldots, T_{n-1}$ subject to the braid relations together with the
quadratic relation

.. math::

    T_j^2 = (q - 1)T_j + q.

Thus if we set $q = 0$ every generator becomes idempotent: $T_j^2 = T_j$. 

The Hecke algebra is well-known and well-studied; it is closely related to the symmetric group and
it appears in a variety of places.

    to prove our compression scheme existence theorem.
